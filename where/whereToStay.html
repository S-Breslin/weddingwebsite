              The wedding party and close family and friends will be staying in
              Ferragudo. <br /><br />This is the area where Sean’s father has
              had an apartment for many years and an area dearly loved by the
              couple. <br /><br />In fact, it is where the couple got engaged.
            </p>
            <img src="couple.jpg" alt="" id="couple" />
            <p>We would invite any guests who wished, to stay here with us.</p>

                Ferragudo is a small fishing village. <br /><br />It is a
                well-kept secret and is very beautiful.
                <br /><br />Accommodation here is not abundant. Therefore we
                recommend booking as early as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                For hotels we recommend Vitor’s Village, Vila Castelo Parque.
                Both hotels are around an 8 minute walk to the main square.
                One2Seven is also very close, it is just a five minute walk from
                the square and Suites @ Portarade is located in the square.
              </p>
              <p>Further hotels include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Agua Hotels Riverside (32 minute walk/ 5 min drive from the
                  square)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Caneiros Luxury House & Suites (28 min walk/ 6 min drive from
                  the square)
                </li>
                <li>Hotel Rural Brícia Du Mar (20 min walk/ 5 min drive)</li>
                <li>Hotel Casabela (21 min walk/ 5 min drive)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you are looking at a hotel on a map and want to know how
                close it is to the square, use ‘Restaurante Portarade’ as a
                reference.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are also a wide variety of accommodations on Airbnb that
                will host from 2 guests to much bigger parties. Again, if you
                wish to know how close the Airbnb is to the square, use
                ‘Restaurante Portarade’ as a reference. <br /><br />
              </p>
              <h3>Places to eat in Ferragudo</h3>
              <p>
                The couple’s favourite spot to eat is O' Velho Novo. The food is
                delicious and the price is very reasonable. <br /><br />For
                lunch, you cannot beat the value for money in Port Arade and the
                food is always good. <br /><br />Portugal is famous for their
                fish. Aria is the couple’s favourite Fish restaurant. A waiter
                will bring out the catch of the day and you can have your pick.
                They bring the fish out for you and debone it in front of you. A
                great experience. <br /><br />If you are looking for something a
                little more up market, Sueste is for you. Probably the most
                expensive restaurant in Ferragudo but the fish is amazing.
                <br /><br />The couple love brunch from Brunch in Rio. The food
                is fab and the interior is both cool in design and temperature.
                <br /><br />For Pizza, the couple always return to Pizzeria
                Delizia. They never fail. <br /><br />If Indian is your cuisine
                of choice then check out Sikandar Indian Cuisine. It is located
                in the square. <br /><br />Tres Macacas is the couples favourite
                bar in Ferragudo.<br /><br />Club Nau is a restaurant/ bar on
                the beach. It does nice lovely cocktails and has live music on
                Sundays during the summer. <br /><br />

              We are very grateful to everyone who is willing to travel to
              Portugal for our wedding and understand that not everyone will
              want to stay where the wedding party are staying.<br /><br />
              Albufera is a great alternative . <br /><br />
              The reception will be held outside Albufera and therefore a good
              location for people who will be attending the main event only.
              <br /><br />This is also a location with an abundance of
              accommodation for our guests.

              <p id="par">There are many areas that are a close boat taxi from Ferragudo – what a way to travel in style. <br><br>This gives you the option to be close to the wedding party, but also gives you more accommodation options and a chance to do your own thing too. <br><br>Praia do Roche is a more touristy destination with plenty of hotels. <br><br>Portimao is bigger area than ferragudo. </p>
